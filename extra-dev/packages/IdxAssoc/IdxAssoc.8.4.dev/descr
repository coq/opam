Associative Arrays.

We define the associative array (key -> value associations)
datatype as list of couples, providing definitions of standards
operations such as adding, deleting.

We introduce predicates for membership of a key and of couples.

Finally we define a search operator ("find") which returns the
value associated with a key or the "none" option (see file
Option.v which should be part of this contribution) on failure.

Lemmas we prove about these concepts were motivated by our needs
at the moment we created this file. We hope they'll suit your
needs too but anyway, feel free to communicate any wish or
remark.
