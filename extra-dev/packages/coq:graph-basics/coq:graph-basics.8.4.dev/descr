a Coq toolkit for graph theory

This library offers inductive definitions of basics
in graph theory. The goal is to offer the possibility to write proofs
and programs on graphs in the same formalism : the Coq language.
It now contains : vertices, arcs, edges, degrees, graphs, directed
graphs,
paths, acyclic graphs, connected graphs and tree.
