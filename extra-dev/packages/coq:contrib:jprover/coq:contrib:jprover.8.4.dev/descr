A theorem prover for first-order intuitionistic logic

JProver is a theorem prover for first-order intuitionistic logic.
It is originally implemented by Stephan Schmitt and then integrated into
MetaPRL by Aleksey Nogin. After this, Huang Guan-Shieng extracted the
necessary ML-codes from MetaPRL and then adapted it to Coq.
