A Coq Toolkit for Lambek Calculus.

This library contains some definitions concerning Lambek calculus.
Three formalisations of this calculus are proposed, and also some certified
functions which translate derivations from one formalism to another.
Several derived properties are proved and also some meta-theorems.
Users can define their own lexicons and use the defined tactics to prove the
derivation of sentences in a particular system (L, NL, LP, NLP ...)
