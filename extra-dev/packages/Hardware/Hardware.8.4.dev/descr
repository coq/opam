Verification and synthesis of hardware linear arithmetic structures.

Verification and synthesis of hardware linear arithmetic
structures. Example of a left-to-right comparator.
Three approaches are tackled :
- the usual verification of a circuit, consisting in proving that the
description satisfies the specification,
- the synthesis of a circuit from its specification using the Coq extractor,
- the same approach as above but using the Program tactic.
