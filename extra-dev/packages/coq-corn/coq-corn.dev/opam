synopsis: "Constructive Coq Repository at Nijmegen."
description: """
The Constructive Coq Repository at Nijmegen, C-CoRN, aims at building
a computer based library of constructive mathematics, formalized in
the theorem prover Coq. It includes the following parts:

* Algebraic Hierarchy

o An axiomatic formalization of the most common algebraic
structures, including setoids, monoids, groups, rings,
fields, ordered fields, rings of polynomials, real and
complex numbers

* Model of the Real Numbers

o Construction of a concrete real number structure
satisfying the previously defined axioms

* Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

o A proof that every non-constant polynomial on the complex
plane has at least one root

* Real Calculus

o A collection of elementary results on real analysis,
including continuity, differentiability, integration,
Taylor's theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus"""
