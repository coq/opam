Finite sets, finite maps, finitely supported functions.

This library is under developpment and an extension of mathematical
component in order to support finite sets and finite maps on
choicetypes (rather that finite types). This includes support for
functions with finite support. Multisets are still experimental.
There also an embryo of generic order and set libary... very experimental.
