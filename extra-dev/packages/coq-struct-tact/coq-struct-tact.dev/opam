synopsis: "Coq library of structural tactics and utility lemmas about lists and finite types"
description: """
StructTact is a Coq library of structural tactics as well as lemmas about
lists, finite types, and orders on strings that use the tactics.
The structural tactics enable a style of proof where hypothesis names
are never mentioned. When automatically generated names change during
proof development, structural tactics will still work."""
