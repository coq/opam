Application of the Generic kildall's Data Flow Analysis Algorithm to a Type and Shape Static Analyses of Bytecode.

This Library provides a generic data flow analysis
algorithm and a proof of its correctness.
This algorithm is then used to perform type and
shape analysis at bytecode level
on a first order functionnal language.
