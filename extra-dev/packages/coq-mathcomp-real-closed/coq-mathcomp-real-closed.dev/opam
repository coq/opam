synopsis: "Mathematical Components Library on real closed fields"
description: """
This library contains definitions and theorems about real closed
fields, with a construction of the real closure and the algebraic
closure (including a proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra). It
also contains a proof of decidability of the first order theory of
real closed field, through quantifier elimination.
