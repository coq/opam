synopsis: "Dioid"
description: """
Definitions of the algebraic structure of dioid following the style of
ssralg in the Mathcomp library.

The main algebraic structures defined are:
* semirings: rings without opposite for the additive law
* dioids: idempotent semirings (i.e., forall x, x + x = x)
* complete dioids: dioids whose canonical order (x <= y wen x + y = y)
  yields a complete lattice
* commutative variants (multiplicative law is commutative)

More details can be found in comments at the beginning of each file.
