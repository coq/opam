Formal Verification of an Incremental Garbage Collector

We specify an incremental garbage collection algorithm and we give a formal proof of its
correctness. The algorithm is represented as an infinite transition system and we establish safety
and liveness properties. This work relies on an axiomatization of LTL and is based on a co-inductive
representation of programs executions. Although motivated by integrating the dynamic memory
management to the Java Card platform, this study applies more generally to real-time embedded systems and to devices with virtually infinite memory.
