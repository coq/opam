synopsis:
  "A Tutorial on Reflecting in Coq the generation of Hoare proof obligations."
description: """
This work is both an introduction to Hoare logic and a demo
illustrating Coq nice features. It formalizes the generation of PO
(proof obligations) in a Hoare logic for a very basic imperative
programming language. It proves the soundness and the completeness of
the PO generation both in partial and total correctness. At last, it
examplifies on a very simple example (a GCD computation) how the PO
generation can simplify concrete proofs. Coq is indeed able to compute
PO on concrete programs: we say here that the generation of proof
obligations is reflected in Coq. Technically, the PO generation is
here performed through Dijkstra's weakest-precondition calculus."""
