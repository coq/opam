synopsis: "Recompiles Coq's standard libary with Tactician's instrumentation loaded"
description: """
  *** WARNING *** This package will overwrite Coq's standard library files.

  This package recompiles Coq's standard library with Tactician's (`coq-tactician`)
  instrumentation loaded such that Tactician can learn from the library. When you
  install this package, the current `.vo` files of the standard library are backed
  in the folder `user-contrib/Tactician/stdlib-backup`. The new `.vo` files are
  equivalent to the originals, except that they also contain Tactician's tactic
  databases. After installation of this package, all other Coq developments that
  are installed will also need to be recompiled. The 'tactician recompile' command
  line utility can help with this.
  Upon removal of this package, the original files will be placed back.
