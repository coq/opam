synopsis: "A function definition package for Rocq"
description: """
Equations is a function definition plugin for Rocq, that allows the
definition of functions by dependent pattern-matching and well-founded,
mutual or nested structural recursion and compiles them into core
terms. It automatically derives the clauses equations, the graph of the
function and its associated elimination principle.
