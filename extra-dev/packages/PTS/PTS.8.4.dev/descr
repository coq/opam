A formalisation of Pure Type Systems.

This contrib is a formalization of Pure Type Systems. It includes most
of the basic metatheoretical properties: weakening, substitution,
subject-reduction, decidability of type-checking (for strongly normalizing
PTSs). Strengtheningis not proven here.

The kernel of a very simple proof checker is automatically generated from
the proofs. A small interface allows interacting with this kernel, making
up a standalone proof system.

The Makefile has a special target "html" that produces html files from the
sources and main.html that gives a short overview.
