Functions in classical ZFC

This mostly repeats Guillaume Alexandre's contribution `zf',
but in classical logic and with a different proof style. We start with a
simple axiomatization of some flavor of ZFC (for example Werner's
implementation of ZFC should provide a model).
We develop some very basic things like pairs, functions, and a little
bit about natural numbers, following the standard classical path.
