# OPAM archive for Coq

All OPAM repositories for Coq packages live here.
Packages are organized according to the [layout](LAYOUT.md).

## Repositories

To activate the repositories:
* all the released packages:

    ```
    opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
    ```

* development versions:

    ```
    opam repo add coq-extra-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/extra-dev
    ```

* development versions of Coq:

    ```
    opam repo add coq-core-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/core-dev
    ```

## Website preprocessor

We follow the model of the Coq website.
One should invoke `make COQWEB=path/to/coq/www` to generate the web pages
using the same header, footer and `yamlpp` used by the Coq website (it is expected to be in `path/to/coq/www/yamlpp-0.3/yamlpp`.  The
destination folder is `www/`.

The templates are in `templates/`.  The file `index.html.in` is first
processed by `scripts/archive2web` that fills in `<tr>` entries, then
`yamlpp` is used to insert the header and footer.

The code in `www/filter.js` is used to interactively browse the contents
of the packages table in `index.html`.  The css file
`www/index-style.css` is also part of the picture.

## Website and OPAM metadata

The website is statically generated looking at the `opam` and `descr` files.

In particular we use the `tags` field of the `opam` file as follows:

 1. strings beginning with `keyword:` are considered as `keywords`
 2. strings beginning with `category:` are considered as `categories`
 3. a string beginning with `date:` is the date the software was last updated
    (not the package)

Example:

    tags: [ "keyword:cool" "keyword:stuff" "category:Some/Category" "date:1992-12-22" ]

Finally the `homepage:`, `author:`, `maintainer:` and `doc:` fields are
also used to generate the package entry.

## Continuous Integration

Incoming pull requests are tested on GitLab CI. **@coqbot** pushes any opened
or synchonized pull request to a branch named `pr-<number>` on GitLab. It will
trigger a CI build. If the CI build runs for too long and times out, any
member of the Coq organization of GitLab can start it again using the "Run
Pipeline" green button at <https://gitlab.com/coq/opam-coq-archive/pipelines>.
This will then build only on runners without pre-set timeouts (the Coq Pyrolyse
server). It may still time out if the build takes longer than the GitLab
project's timeout setting (10 hours).
