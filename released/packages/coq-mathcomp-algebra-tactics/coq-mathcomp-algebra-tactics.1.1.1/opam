synopsis: "Ring, field, lra, nra, and psatz tactics for Mathematical Components"
description: """
This library provides `ring`, `field`, `lra`, `nra`, and `psatz` tactics for
algebraic structures of the Mathematical Components library. The `ring` and
`field` tactics respectively work with any `comRingType` and `fieldType`. The
other (Micromega) tactics work with any `realDomainType` or `realFieldType`.
Their instance resolution is done through canonical structure inference.
Therefore, they work with abstract rings and do not require `Add Ring` and
`Add Field` commands. Another key feature of this library is that they
automatically push down ring morphisms and additive functions to leaves of
ring/field expressions before applying the proof procedures."""
