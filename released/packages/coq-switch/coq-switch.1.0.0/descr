A plugin to imlement functionality similar to `switch` statement in C
language.

It allows easier dispatch on several constant values of a type with
decidable equality. Given a type, boolean equality predicate, and list
of choices, will generate (using TemplateCoq) an inductive type with
constructors, one for each of the choices, and a function mapping
values to this type.
