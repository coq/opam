synopsis: "Inductive Definition Transformers"
description: """
This Coq library allows you to transform an inductive definition to another
inductive definition, by providing a constructor transformer tactic. It can be
used to generate boilerplate lemmas for backward and forward reasoning, and to
generate inductive types with many similar cases.
