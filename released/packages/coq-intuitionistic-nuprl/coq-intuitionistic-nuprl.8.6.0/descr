An Impredicative Model of Nuprl's Constructive Type Theory

http://www.nuprl.org/html/Nuprl2Coq/

This library formalizes Nuprl's Constructive Type Theory (CTT) as of
2015.  CTT is an extensional type theory originally inspired by
Martin-Lof's extensional type theory, and that has since then been
extended with several new types such as: intersection types, union
types, image types, partial types, set types, quotient types, partial
equivalence relation (per) types, simulation and bisimulation types,
an atom type, and the "Base" type.

Our formalization includes a definition of Nuprl's computation system,
a definition of Howe's computational equivalence relation and a proof
that it is a congruence, an impredicative definition of Nuprl's type
system using Allen's PER semantics (using Prop's impredicativity, we
can formalize Nuprl's infinite hierarchy of universes), definitions of
most (but not all) of Nuprl's inference rules and proofs that these
rules are valid w.r.t. Allen's PER semantics, and a proof of Nuprl's
consistency.

In addition to the standard introduction and elimination rules for
Nuprl's types, we have also proved several Brouwerian rules.  Our
computation system also contains: (1) free choice sequences that we
used to prove Bar Induction rules; (2) named exceptions and a "fresh"
operator to generate fresh names, that we used to prove a continuity
rule.
