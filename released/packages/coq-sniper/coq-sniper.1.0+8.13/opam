synopsis: "A Coq plugin for general proof automation"
description: """
Sniper is a Coq plugin that provides a new Coq tactic, snipe, for general proof automation.

This plugin is an extension of SMTCoq, a plugin to safely call external SMT solvers from Coq. Sniper extends SMTCoq by translating (a subset) of Coq goals into first-order logic before calling SMTCoq.

The translation is implemented through a combination of modular, small transformations that independently eliminate specific aspects of Coq logic towards first-order logic. These small transformations are safe, either generating proof terms on the fly (certifying transformations) or being proved once and for all in Coq (certified transformations).
