synopsis:
  "This package provides a Coq formalization of abstract algebra using"
description: """
a functional programming style. The modules contained within the
 package span monoids, groups, rings, and fields and provides both
 axiom definitions for these structures and proofs of foundational
 results. The current package contains over 800 definitions and
 proofs.

This module is unique in that it eschews the tactic-oriented
style of traditional Coq developments. As pointed out by others,
programs written in that style are brittle, hard to read, and
generally inefficient.

While tactic driven development is useful for sketching out proofs,
these disadvantages should dissuade us from publising proofs in
this form.

In this library, I provide a worked example of using Gallina
directly and demonstrate both the feasibility of this approach
and its advantages in terms of clarity, maintainability, and
compile-time efficiency.

In addition, this module includes two expression simplifiers. The
first, defined in monoid_expr.v simplifies monoid expressions. The
second, defined in group_expr.v simplifies group expressions.

These functions allow us to automate many of the steps involved in
proving algebraic theorems directly in Gallina, and represent an
alternative to relying on tactics such as auto, omega, etc.
