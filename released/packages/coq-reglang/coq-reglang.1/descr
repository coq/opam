Regular Language Representations in the Constructive Type Theory of Coq

We verify translations between different representations of regular
languages: various forms of automata (deterministic, nondeterministic,
one-way, two-way), regular expressions, and the logic WS1S. We also
show various decidability results and closure properties.
