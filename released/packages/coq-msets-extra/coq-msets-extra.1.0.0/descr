Extensions of MSets for Efficient Execution

Coq's MSet library provides various, reasonably efficient finite set
implementations. Nevertheless, FireEye was nevertheless struggling
with performance issues.

This library contains extensions to Coq's MSet library that helped
the FireEye Formal Methods team (formal-methods@fireeye.com),
solve these performance issues. There are

- Fold With Abort
  efficient folding with possibility to  start late and stop early

- Interval Sets
  a memory efficient representation of sets of numbers
  
- Unsorted Lists with Duplicates
