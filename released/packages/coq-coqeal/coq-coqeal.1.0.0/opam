synopsis: "CoqEAL - The Coq Effective Algebra Library"
description: """
This libary contains a subset of the work that was developed in the context of the ForMath european project (2009-2013). It has two parts:
- theory (module CoqEAL_theory), which contains formal developments in algebra and optimized algorithms on mathcomp data structures.
- refinements (module CoqEAL_refinements), which is a framework to ease change of data representation during a proof.
