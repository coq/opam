Icharate: A logical Toolkit for Multimodal Categorial Grammars.

http://www.labri.fr/perso/anoun/Icharate

The logical toolkit ICHARATE is built upon a formalization of
multimodal categorial grammars in Coq proof assistant.
This toolkit aims at facilitating the study of these
complicated formalisms by allowing users to build interactively the
syntactic derivations of different sentences, compute their
semantic interpretations and also prove universal properties of entire
classes of grammars using a collection of already established derived
rules. Several tactics are defined to ease the interaction with users.
