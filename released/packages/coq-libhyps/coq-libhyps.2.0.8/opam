description: "
This library defines a set of tactics to manipulate hypothesis
individually or by group. In particular it allows applying a tactic on
each hypothesis of a goal, or only on *new* hypothesis after some
tactic. Examples of manipulations: automatic renaming, subst, revert,
or any tactic expecting a hypothesis name as argument.

It DOES NOT provide ANYMORE the especialize tactic to ease forward
reasoning by instantianting one, several or all premisses of a
hypothesis. Ths is due to coq's specialize being less permissive about
evars. This may be fixed in the future.
