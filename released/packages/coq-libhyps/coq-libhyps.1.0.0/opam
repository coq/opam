description: "
This library defines a set of tactics to manipulate hypothesis
indivually or by group. In particular it allows to apply a tactic on
each hypothesis of a goal, or only *new* hypothesis after some tactic.
Manipulations include: automatic renaming, decomposition, extracting
premisses, but define your own manipulation on (groups of) hypothesis.
