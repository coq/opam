A general-purpose alternative to Coq's standard library.

TLC relies on the axioms of functional extensionality, propositional
extensionality, and indefinite description (also known as Hilbert's epsilon
operator). The consequences of these axioms include the law of the excluded
middle as well as proof irrelevance. Accepting these axioms often makes life
significantly simpler.

TLC takes advantage of Coq's type class mechanism. In particular, this allows
for common operators and lemma names for all container data structures and all
order relations.

TLC includes the optimal fixed point combinator, which allows
arbitrarily-complex recursive and co-recursive definitions.

TLC provides a collection of tactics that enhance the default tactics provided
by Coq. These tactics help construct more concise and more robust proof
scripts.
