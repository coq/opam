synopsis: "A Coq formalization of the axiomatic definition of real numbers"
description: """
This repository presents a Coq formalization of the axiomatic definition of real numbers,
guided by the 2nd chapter of Zorich's Mathematical Analysis (Part I, 7th expanded edition) and
based on the formalization of Morse-Kelley (MK) set theory.
In this work, the key algebraic properties and the uniqueness of real number structure are verified.
