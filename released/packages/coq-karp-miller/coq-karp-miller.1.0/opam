synopsis: "Certified Karp-Miller algorithm for the covering of Petri nets"
description: """
   Based on the Kruskal-AlmostFull library, we build two correct by construction Karp-Miller
   algorithms: the first one decides for the coverability problem; and the second one, a
   refined version, builds the Karp-Miller tree and, either a path in that tree giving a covering, 
   or a proof that no such path exists in the Karp-Miller trees.
