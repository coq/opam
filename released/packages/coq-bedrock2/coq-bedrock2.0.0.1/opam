synopsis: "A work-in-progress language and compiler for verified low-level programming"
description: """
bedrock2 is a low-level systems programming language. One piece
of the puzzle is a verified compiler targeting RISC-V. The source
language itself is also equipped with a simple program logic for
proving correctness of the source programs.

The project has similar goals as bedrock, but uses a different design.
No code is shared between bedrock and bedrock2.

The source language is a C-like language called ExprImp. It is an
imperative language with expressions. Currently, the only data type
is word (32-bit or 64-bit), and the memory is a partial map from words
to bytes. Records are supported as a notation for memory access with an offset.
