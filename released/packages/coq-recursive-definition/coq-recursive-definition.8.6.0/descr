ML-like recursive definitions.

This module provides a facility to define recursive functions in
an ML-like style, giving a fixpoint equation, a variant and a
well-founded relation. A pure function is then generated, together with
a theorem giving the fixpoint equation.
THIS IS MAINLY A TEST CONTRIB, BEFORE INTEGRATION IN COQ.
