On Ordinal Notations.

This contribution contains data structures for ordinals
less than Gamma0 under Cantor and Veblen normal
forms. Well-foundedness is established thanks to RPO with status for
generic terms. This contribution also includes termination proofs of
Hydra battles and Goodstein sequences as well as a computation of the
length of the Goodstein sequence starting from 4 in base 2.
