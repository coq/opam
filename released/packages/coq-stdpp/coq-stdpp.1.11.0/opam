synopsis: "An extended \"Standard Library\" for Coq"
description: """
The key features of this library are as follows:

- It provides a great number of definitions and lemmas for common data
  structures such as lists, finite maps, finite sets, and finite multisets.
- It uses type classes for common notations (like `∅`, `∪`, and Haskell-style
  monad notations) so that these can be overloaded for different data structures.
- It uses type classes to keep track of common properties of types, like it
  having decidable equality or being countable or finite.
- Most data structures are represented in canonical ways so that Leibniz
  equality can be used as much as possible (for example, for maps we have
  `m1 = m2` iff `∀ i, m1 !! i = m2 !! i`). On top of that, the library provides
  setoid instances for most types and operations.
- It provides various tactics for common tasks, like an ssreflect inspired
  `done` tactic for finishing trivial goals, a simple breadth-first solver
  `naive_solver`, an equality simplifier `simplify_eq`, a solver `solve_proper`
  for proving compatibility of functions with respect to relations, and a solver
  `set_solver` for goals involving set operations.
- It is entirely dependency- and axiom-free.
