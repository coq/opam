synopsis: "Smpl: An Extensible Tactic for Coq"
description: """
Smpl is useful for proof automation in Coq. Smpl provides named lists
of tactics to which tactics can be added with Coq commands. A special
tactic called 'smpl foo' executes the tactics in the lists named foo
in order, until one of them succeeds. Smpl works across modules by
merging tactics from all imports according to a priority number that
can be provided upon addition. Smpl thus allows to modify the behavior
of a tactic after it is defined in a convenient and modular way.
