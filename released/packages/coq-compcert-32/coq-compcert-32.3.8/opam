synopsis: "The CompCert C compiler (32 bit)"
description: "This package installs the 32 bit version of CompCert.
For coexistence with the 64 bit version, the files are installed in:
%{prefix}%/variants/compcert32/bin  (ccomp and clightgen binaries)
%{prefix}%/variants/compcert32/lib/compcert  (C library)
%{lib}%/coq-variant/compcert32/compcert (Coq library)
Please note that the coq module path is compcert and not compcert32,
so the files cannot be directly Required as compcert32.
Instead -Q or -R options must be used to bind the compcert32 folder
to the module path compcert. This is more convenient if one development
supports both 32 and 64 bit versions. Otherwise all files would have to
be duplicated with module paths compcert and compcert32.
Please also note that the binary folder is usually not in the path."
