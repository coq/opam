synopsis: "A Coq library for tree calculus" # One-line description
description: """
 This library accompanies the book *Reflective Programs in Tree Calculus*. 
In tree calculus, computations are given by natural trees, i.e. finitely-branching trees without labels.
The functions, data structures, programs, inputs, outputs and values are all given by binary trees. 
The trees are built as combinations of a single operator. It has three evaluation rules, for leaves stems and forks. 
This is enough to support reflective programs such as a size function that can decide its own size, 
an equality program that can decide its own equality, and self-evaluators than can evaluate themselves. 
Since this does not require any meta-theory for, say, substitution, quotation, serialisation or Goedel numbers, 
it is simpler and more powerful than traditional models of computation.  

The organisation of the proofs is shown in the _CoqProject file, with one or two files per chapter.
