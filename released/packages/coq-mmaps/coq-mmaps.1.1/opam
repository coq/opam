synopsis: "Several implementations of finite maps over arbitrary ordered types using Coq functors"
description: """
This project contains several implementations of finite maps,
including implementations based on AVL trees and red-black trees.
The finite maps are parameterized on arbitrary ordered types using
Coq functors. This is an updated version of the Coq Stdlib's FMaps
that is meant to complement the Stdlib's MSet library."""
