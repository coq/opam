synopsis: "Matrix by fin (finite set over nat) in Coq" # One-line description
description: """
  FinMatrix is a formal matrix library in Coq, which we started from
  finite sets (over natural numbers), vecotr based on finite sets, and
  matrices based on vectors. This implementation differs from the
  CoqMatrix project(https://github.com/zhengpushi/CoqMatrix), which
  have various models.

  We have formalized many algebraic and geometric vector or matrix
  theories, especially including two inversion matrix algorithms:
  minvGE (inversion based on Gauss Elimination), minvAM (inversion
  based on Adjoint Matrix).
