synopsis: "A Coq plugin that checks proof witnesses coming from external SAT and SMT solvers"
description: """
- a certified checker for proof witnesses coming from the SAT solver ZChaff and the SMT solvers veriT and CVC4. This checker increases the confidence in these tools by checking their answers a posteriori and allows to import new theroems proved by these solvers in Coq;
- decision procedures through new tactics that discharge some Coq goals to ZChaff, veriT, CVC4, and their combination"""
