A formalisation of the IEEE754 norm on floating-point arithmetic.

This library contains a non-verified implementation of
binary floating-point addition and multiplication operators inspired
by the IEEE-754 standard. It is today outdated.

See the attached 1997 report rapport-stage-dea.ps.gz for a discussion
(in French) of this work.

For the state of the art at the time of updating this notice, see
e.g. "Flocq: A Unified Library for Proving Floating-point Algorithms
in Coq" by S. Boldo and G. Melquiond, 2011.
