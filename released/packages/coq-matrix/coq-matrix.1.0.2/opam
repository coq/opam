synopsis: "Formal matrix theory with multiple implementations in Coq" # One-line description
description: """
  Matrix is an important mathematical tool. Although there are at least five matrix 
  models/libraries in Coq community, the massive verification project involving matrix 
  are still facing some problems:
  (1). There havn't a full-feature formal matrix library, because the matrix theory is 
  complex and need more time to formalize it.
  (2). Different libraries of these implementations cannot be easily switched at the 
  later stage of a verification process, because the type of operations and theorems 
  are different. But some project maybe need more matrix theories while the needed 
  theorems only avaiable in another libraries.

  Thus, we provide a unified framework for different implementations of formal matrix
  models, so as to decouple the difference between underlying technologies and 
  upper-level applications.
