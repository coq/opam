synopsis: "Implementation of Friedman's TREE function based on Kruskal's theorem"
description: """
   Friedman's TREE function is an extremely fast growing function that
   plays a role in reverse mathematics, that is the classification of
   mathematical theories w.r.t. what kind of theorems can be proved within
   those theories or what kind of functions they can prove exist. 
   See the README.md file for further description.
