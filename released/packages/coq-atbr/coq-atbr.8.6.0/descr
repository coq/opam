A tactic for deciding Kleene algebras.

This library provides algebraic tools for working with
binary relations. The main tactic we provide is a reflexive tactic for
solving (in)equations in an arbitrary Kleene algebra. The decision
procedure goes through standard finite automata constructions, that we
formalized.
