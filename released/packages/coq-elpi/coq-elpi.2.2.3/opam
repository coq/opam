synopsis: "Elpi extension language for Coq"
description:
  "Coq-elpi provides a Coq plugin that embeds ELPI. It also provides a way to embed Coq's terms into λProlog using the Higher-Order Abstract Syntax approach and a way to read terms back. In addition to that it exports to ELPI a set of Coq's primitives, e.g. printing a message, accessing the environment of theorems and data types, defining a new constant and so on. For convenience it also provides a quotation and anti-quotation for Coq's syntax in λProlog. E.g., `{{nat}}` is expanded to the type name of natural numbers, or `{{A -> B}}` to the representation of a product by unfolding the `->` notation. Finally it provides a way to define new vernacular commands and new tactics."
