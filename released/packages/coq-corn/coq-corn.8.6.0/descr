Coq Repository at Nijmegen


 The Coq Repository at Nijmegen, CoRN, includes the following parts:

*  Algebraic Hierarchy

   o An axiomatic formalization of the most common algebraic
     structures, including setoids, monoids, groups, rings,
     fields, ordered fields, rings of polynomials, real and
     complex numbers

* Model of the Real Numbers

   o Construction of a concrete real number structure
     satisfying the previously defined axioms

* Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

   o A proof that every non-constant polynomial on the complex
     plane has at least one root

* Real Calculus

   o A collection of elementary results on real analysis,
     including continuity, differentiability, integration,
     Taylor's theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

* Exact Real Computation
   o Fast verified computation inside Coq. This includes: real numbers, functions,
     integrals, graphs of functions, differential equations.

CoRN depends on the math-classes contribution. This mostly replaces the old algebraic hierarchy.

The author list is roughly in anti-chronological order.
