synopsis: "The Coq Constructive Repository at Nijmegen"
description: """
CoRN includes the following parts:

- Algebraic Hierarchy

  An axiomatic formalization of the most common algebraic
  structures, including setoids, monoids, groups, rings,
  fields, ordered fields, rings of polynomials, real and
  complex numbers

- Model of the Real Numbers

  Construction of a concrete real number structure
  satisfying the previously defined axioms

- Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

  A proof that every non-constant polynomial on the complex
  plane has at least one root

- Real Calculus

  A collection of elementary results on real analysis,
  including continuity, differentiability, integration,
  Taylor's theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

- Exact Real Computation

  Fast verified computation inside Coq. This includes: real numbers, functions,
  integrals, graphs of functions, differential equations.
